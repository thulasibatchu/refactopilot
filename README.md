ü§ñ RefactoPilot
An AI-powered assistant that provides context-aware refactoring suggestions directly in your VS Code editor.

RefactoPilot goes beyond simple static analysis. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to understand the context of your entire codebase, offering intelligent insights to help you write cleaner, more maintainable code.

üöÄ Features
Context-Aware Analysis: Understands your entire project to provide suggestions based on existing patterns and duplicated logic.

AI-Powered Suggestions: Leverages Large Language Models to generate human-like explanations and refactored code snippets.

Seamless IDE Integration: Right-click any function name in VS Code to get instant analysis and feedback.

Semantic Understanding: Uses Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to parse code, ensuring a deep and accurate understanding of your project's structure.
